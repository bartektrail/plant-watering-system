# plant-watering-system  

This project is created to play with Arduino and IoT solutions.
It should help in watering plants at home to keep them full of life.
Current implmentation checks soil moisture every second and show it's level using 3 LED diods

## Sensor problem

Current implementation was working for 5 days. 
After that time one leg of the moisture sensor had destroyed because of continued work.
Probalby because of the electrolysis?

Possible solution:
Power should be turned on only for measurment purposes, and measurment should be prepared once a while (eg. 1 hour).
